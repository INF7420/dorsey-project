  <h1>Deborah Dorsey    About Me</h1>

  <p>Twenty five years of work at the Detroit Public Library (DPL), along with community experiences and undergraduate studies have heavily influenced my desire to complete the WSU-SLIS graduate program. I have accumulated and can refer to a plethora of resourceful insight concerning DPL’s daily operations and procedures.  Completion of this program will provide me with the skills necessary to design and implement multifaceted library analytical research projects for the purpose of organizational planning and development.</p>

  <p>Over a span of sixteen years, I worked in several departments as a clerk performing office support duties and providing assistance to DPL customers. Superb training from management and self-motivation assisted me in developing excellent interpersonal skills and gaining extensive knowledge of library resources located in various departments. Working in public service departments also provided an opportunity for me to closely observe internal department operations, and the roles and responsibilities associated with each position.</p>

  <p>I have accumulated an additional nine years of service as an administrative assistant supporting the Marketing Department and Business and Financial Operations for the first six years. For the past three years, I have supported the Office of the Executive Director. This has allowed me to observe and support the execution and results of administrative decisions from a different perspective. I learned that every decision should take into consideration customer needs, staff capacity and budget parameters. With these considerations in mind, administrators must make strategic decisions that ensure the library’s ability to provide quality services and programs to its customers.</p>

  <p>Obtaining a Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies and minor degree in Non-profit Studies from WSU College of Liberal Arts and Sciences provided me with skills to conduct need assessments, write proposals and implement projects for individuals and small groups. It was my goal was to create community projects that engaged residents in neighborhood revitalization. This was successfully done with the West Grand Boulevard Collaborative, a non-profit located in Detroit.</p>

  <p>My current desire is to pursue a Library and Information Science degree and transition into a library career. I am particularly interested in two specializations. The Data Analytics specialization curriculum provides the instruction necessary for me to gain knowledge and analytical research skills to produce insights regarding the library and its “big data.”  This information will help support strategic decisions and substantiate library proposals.  As technology continues to become a greater part of library services, I intend to blend several courses from the User Experience curriculum into my professional development. I believe it is beneficial to understand, for analytical research purposes, information behavior and how staff and customers interact with computers.</p>
